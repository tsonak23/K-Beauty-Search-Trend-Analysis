 K-Beauty-Search-Trend-Analysis

 🔖 Project Overview : The rapid expansion of Korean skincare brands on Indian platforms like Nykaa sparked an important question:
                        Is the rise of K-Beauty in India driven by sustained consumer interest — or short-term marketing momentum?
                        This project analyzes 5 years of Google Trends search data to understand how interest in 10 major K-Beauty brands has evolved over time.

  🎯 Objective : To evaluate brand-level search behavior and identify:
                         
                        * Year-over-year growth patterns
                        
                        * Visual comparison of steady vs spike-driven search trends

   📙 Dataset : 
   
        * Source: Google Trends

        * Region: India

        * Time Period: ( Jan 2021 – Jan 2026)

        * Granularity: Monthly search interest index (0–100)

        * Brands Analyzed: Beauty of Joseon, COSRX, Dr. Jart+, Innisfree, Klairs, Laneige, Missha, Pyunkang Yul, Sulwhasoo, The Face Shop.

        
🛠 Methodology : The analysis includes:

              * 5-year average search interest comparison

              * Year-over-Year (YoY) growth analysis

              * Brand-wise trend visualization

              * Visual comparison of steady vs spike-driven search patterns

🔍 Key Observations : 

        * Some brands demonstrate steady long-term growth, indicating sustained market interest.

        * Fluctuations in search behavior may align with influencer collaborations, celebrity endorsements, or new product launches.

        * Search data does not directly explain the cause — but it provides early signals of market movement.

🚀 Next Phase : In Part 2, brands will be classified into:

                * Emerging

                * Mature

                * Declining
